#Mise en place

```
Mise-en-place is the religion of all good line cooks...
The universe is in order when your station is set up the way you like it:
you know where to find everything with your eyes closed, everything you
need during the course of the shift is at the ready at arm’s reach,
your defenses are deployed.
—Anthony Bourdain
```

Just run **make** and your archlinux should be setup just like mine, which is a crap :D.
